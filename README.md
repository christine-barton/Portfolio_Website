## Setup
Microsoft Azure Web Services

You need a place to be able to edit html and css files. I used Visual Studio Code. You would start with finding a template online and downloading it. Then editing the information to be your own. Then uploading all of this to your own GitHub and creating a Static Web App on Azure to go with it. You can use the link they give you or use your own domain by creating it on namecheap. If you get a domain you then need to link up your domain with the web service app. 

## Usage
Someone could use it to see how to build a website and connect a domain link to it. You could download the template I have in the GitHub by downloading all the files and filling in the information with your own.

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_
